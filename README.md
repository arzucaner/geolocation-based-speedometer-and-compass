# Geolocation Based Speedometer and Compass

---

## In this project, I built a speedometer and compass that are based on the user's geolocation. The program uses the Geolocation API to obtain the user's current location, as well as their speed and heading. The speedometer displays the user's current speed in both kilometers per hour and miles per hour. The compass displays the user's current heading in degrees.

The program uses JavaScript and CSS to create the speedometer and compass designs, and to update the displays in real-time as the user moves. The Geolocation API provides the necessary data to calculate the user's speed and heading, which are then used to update the displays.

Overall, this project provides a fun and practical application of the Geolocation API, and allows participants to practice their JavaScript and CSS skills in creating custom visualizations for displaying geolocation data.
